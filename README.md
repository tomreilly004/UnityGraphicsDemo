This feature shows a volcano erupting with multiple different sized rocks exploding from the top leaving a crater. Particle systems are used for the smoke and fire coming out from the top.

The features being shown here are a glowing orb rotating and pivoting around its parent (the tip of the pyramid), which is also rotating on its axis in the opposite direction. The pyramid is also reflecting the pink emission from the orb in real time. The third feature being shown here is the blue and red lights twinkling in the sky that only show up when the sun goes down.

A weather feature is also shown here with a sandstorm blowing across the map. This was done using multiple particle systems which increase their velocity overtime.

A waterfall is also contained within the scene. The waterfall is made up of multiple particle systems to show the initial water and spray from the top to the moving pool and splash at the bottom.
